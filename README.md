## 🚀 Installation & Local Setup

To run this project on your own computer, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nextgen-sports-lab.git](https://github.com/your-username/nextgen-sports-lab.git)
cd nextgen-sports-lab

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.10 or 3.11 installed. Then, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up Your API Key (Crucial!)
To use the Gemini AI, you must provide your own API key securely.
 * Get a free API key from Google AI Studio.
 * Inside the main project folder, create a hidden folder named .streamlit.
 * Inside that folder, create a file named secrets.toml.
 * Paste your key into the file exactly like this:
<!-- end list -->
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-actual-api-key-here"

4. Add the Background Image
Ensure you have a high-resolution black-and-white gym/sports image named exactly background.jpg saved in the main project directory. (If this is missing, the app will safely fallback to a cloud-hosted default image).
5. Run the Application
streamlit run app.py

☁️ Deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud
If you are hosting this project live on Streamlit Cloud:
 * Connect your GitHub repository to Streamlit.
 * Ensure requirements.txt is in the root directory.
 * DO NOT upload your secrets.toml file to GitHub.
 * Instead, go to your Streamlit Cloud Dashboard -> Click the three dots (⋮) next to your app -> Settings -> Secrets.
 * Paste your GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-key" directly into that secure cloud vault and hit Save.
🛑 Troubleshooting Common Errors
 * google.api_core.exceptions.NotFound or API Key missing: Ensure your GEMINI_API_KEY is spelled correctly in your Streamlit Secrets and wrapped in quotation marks.
 * 429 Resource Exhausted / Quota Exceeded: You are testing too fast! The free tier of Gemini limits how many questions you can ask per minute. Wait 60 seconds and try clicking "Send" again.
 * Red Track Background is showing instead of B&W: Double-check that your image is named exactly background.jpg (all lowercase, no spaces) and is sitting directly next to app.py in your folder structure, not hidden inside a sub-folder.
